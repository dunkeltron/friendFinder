# friendFinder
The goal of Friend Finder site is to allow people to connect in a more easy fashion.
We aim to do this by having a website that allows users to put up their name and a link to a photo of themselves. The users also answer a ten question quiz of personality questions. Upon submitting the survey the site calculates the best match from people already in the site's database.
The site then displays the best matched person's name and picture.

Users can interact with the deployed site at https://young-garden-34198.herokuapp.com/

For question make sure to contact the dev team on the git repo
